                        <p>I create software to extract data from the web, primarily. I also do all the fun stuff around data scraping, like integrations with other services or creating full-blown dashboards with real-time data from multiple websites.</p>

                        <h2>Let's get weird with it</h2>
                        <p>Look, I'm not here to bore you with corporate jargon or promise you the moon. I'm a cat who scrapes data, remember? But here's the deal: if you've got a data problem that's making you pull your hair out (or fur, in my case), I'm your go-to feline. Whether it's extracting data from a website that seems to hate scrapers, or building a system that updates faster than you can say "meow," I'm game. Let's get weird, let's get creative, and let's solve your data nightmares together. After all, cats are notorious for their curiosity, and I'm itching to sink my claws into your unique challenge.</p>
