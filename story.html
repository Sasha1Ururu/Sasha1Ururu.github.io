                        <h2>Freelance</h2>
                            <p>I started as a freelancer 5 years ago.</p>
                            <p>I worked as freelancer on mostly Ukrainian freelance platforms. Their services are superior frankly.
But due to political reasons completly outside of my control that is no longer an option.
Now I prefer not to use any platform.</p>

                        <h2>Freelance is fire</h2>
                        <p>I'm made for this:</p>
                        <p>I like to deliver value directly to the client.</p>
                        <p>To understand what the client needs better then he does.</p>
                        <p>To be solo in charge and bear complete responsibility.</p>

                        <h2>Corpo</h2>
                        <p>I tried to work in a company with ~200 employees for one year.</p>
                        <p>Wonderful company with great values, people and tasks.</p>
                        <p>But that's just not for me. I worry about the end result too much, and in big company there is too much to worry about. It eats me alive, so I prefer to keep my operations small from that moment.</p>
                        <p></p>

                        <h2>LLM experiments</h2>
                        <p>Once LLMs became a thing - I enthusiastically jumped into it.</p>
                        <p>Using it everyday since.</p>
                        <p>Yay AI!</p>
                        <p>If you want to incorporate LLM/vLLMs into your project - I'm all in!</p>
