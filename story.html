                        <h2>Freelance</h2>
                        <p>I started as a freelancer ~5 years ago.</p>
                        <p>I love Ukrainian freelance platforms. Their services are superior frankly.</p>
                        <p>But that is no longer an option due to political reasons completly outside of my control.</p>
                        <p>Now I prefer not to use any platform.</p>

                    <div class="block">
                        <h2>Freelance is fire</h2>
                        <p>I'm made for this:</p>
                        <p>I like to deliver value directly to the client.</p>
                        <p>To understand what the client needs better then he does.</p>
                        <p>To be solo in charge and bear complete responsibility.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="block">
                        <h2>Corpo</h2>
                        <p>I worked in a company named [redacted] with ~200 employees for one year.</p>
                        <p>Wonderful company with great values, people and tasks.</p>
                        <p>top tier infrastructure - from CI/CD to various dev tools.</p>
                        <p>I admire what a bunch of talents can build together.</p>
                        <p>But that's just not for me. I worry about the end result too much.</p>
                        <p>And in big company there is too much to worry about.</p>
                        <p>It eats me alive, so I prefer to keep my operations small from that moment.</p>

                        <h2>LLM experiments</h2>
                        <p>Once LLMs became a thing - I enthusiastically jumped into it.</p>
                        <p>Using it everyday since.</p>
                        <p>Yay AI!</p>
